  abstract = {Using a variational method, we exhibit a surprisingly simple periodic orbit for the newtonian problem of three equal masses in the plane. The orbit has zero angular momentum and a very rich symmetry pattern. Its most surprising feature is that the three bodies chase each other around a fixed eight-shaped curve. Setting aside collinear motions, the only other known motion along a fixed curve in the inertial plane is the ``Lagrange relative equilibrium" in which the three bodies form a rigid equilateral triangle which rotates at constant angular velocity within its circumscribing circle. Our orbit visits in turns every ``Euler configuration" in which one of the bodies sits at the midpoint of the segment defined by the other two (Figure 1). Numerical computations by Carles Sim\textbackslash{}'o, to be published elsewhere, indicate that the orbit is ``stable" (i.e. completely elliptic with torsion). Moreover, they show that the moment of inertia I(t) with respect to the center of mass and the potential U(t) as functions of time are almost constant.},

It contains the 172 known low-mass companions with orbits established through radial velocity and transit measurements around stars within 200 pc. We include five previously unpublished exoplanets orbiting the stars HD 11964, HD 66428, HD 99109, HD 107148, and HD 164922. We update orbits for 83 additional exoplanets, including many whose orbits have not been revised since their announcement, and include radial velocity time series from the Lick, Keck, and Anglo-Australian Observatory planet searches. Both these new and previously published velocities are more precise here due to improvements in our data reduction pipeline, which we applied to archival spectra. We present a brief summary of the global properties of the known exoplanets, including their distributions of orbital semimajor axis, minimum mass, and orbital eccentricity.},

The planetary companion of HD 76700 has a circular orbit with a period of 3.98 days. With M sin i = (0.197 ± 0.017)MJ, or 0.69MSAT, it is one of the lowest minimum mass extrasolar planets yet detected. The remaining planets all have elliptical orbits with periods ranging from 190.5 days to 4.4 yr. All four planets have been found orbiting hosts from a subsample of 20 metal-enriched and faint (V {$<$} 9) stars, which was added to the Anglo-Australian Planet Search's magnitude-limited V {$<$} 7.5 main sample in 1999 October. These stars were selected for metal enrichment on the basis of their Strömgren photometry, and their enrichment has been subsequently confirmed by detailed spectroscopic analysis.},
