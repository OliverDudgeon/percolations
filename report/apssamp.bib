	abstract = {A new approach for the determination of the critical percolation concentration, percolation probabilities, and cluster size distributions is presented for the site percolation problem. The novel "cluster multiple labeling technique" is described for both two- and three-dimensional crystal structures. Its distinctive feature is the assignment of alternate labels to sites belonging to the same cluster. These sites are members of a simulated finite random lattice. An algorithm useful for the determination of the critical percolation concentration of a finite lattice is also presented. This algorithm is especially useful when applied in conjunction with the cluster multiple labeling technique. The basic features of this technique are illustrated by applying it to a small planar square lattice. Numerical results are given for a triangular subcrystal containing up to 9 000 000 sites. These results compare favorably with the exact value of the infinite lattice critical percolation concentration.},

	abstract = {We revisit well-established concepts of epidemiology, the Ising-model, and percolation theory. Also, we employ a spin \$S\$ = 1/2 Ising-like model and a (logistic) Fermi-Dirac-like function to describe the spread of Covid-19. Our analysis reinforces well-established literature results, namely: {\textbackslash}emph\{i\}) that the epidemic curves can be described by a Gaussian-type function; {\textbackslash}emph\{ii\}) that the temporal evolution of the accumulative number of infections and fatalities follow a logistic function, which has some resemblance with a distorted Fermi-Dirac-like function; {\textbackslash}emph\{iii\}) the key role played by the quarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an {\textbackslash}emph\{interacting\} parameter, which emulates the contact between infected and non-infected people. Furthermore, in the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that: {\textbackslash}emph\{i\}) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of a person being infected with Covid-19; {\textbackslash}emph\{ii\}) the concepts of blocked and non-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person respecting or not the social distancing, impacting thus in the probability of an infected person to infect other people. Increasing the number of infected people leads to an increase in the number of net connections, giving rise thus to a higher probability of new infections (percolation). We demonstrate the importance of social distancing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 in a pedagogical way. Given the impossibility of making a precise forecast of the disease spread, we highlight the importance of taking into account additional factors, such as climate changes and urbanization, in the mathematical description of epidemics. Yet, we make a connection between the standard mathematical models employed in epidemics and well-established concepts in condensed matter Physics, such as the Fermi gas and the Landau Fermi-liquid picture.},
