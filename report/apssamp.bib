	abstract = {A new approach for the determination of the critical percolation concentration, percolation probabilities, and cluster size distributions is presented for the site percolation problem. The novel "cluster multiple labeling technique" is described for both two- and three-dimensional crystal structures. Its distinctive feature is the assignment of alternate labels to sites belonging to the same cluster. These sites are members of a simulated finite random lattice. An algorithm useful for the determination of the critical percolation concentration of a finite lattice is also presented. This algorithm is especially useful when applied in conjunction with the cluster multiple labeling technique. The basic features of this technique are illustrated by applying it to a small planar square lattice. Numerical results are given for a triangular subcrystal containing up to 9 000 000 sites. These results compare favorably with the exact value of the infinite lattice critical percolation concentration.},

	abstract = {We revisit well-established concepts of epidemiology, the Ising-model, and percolation theory. Also, we employ a spin \$S\$ = 1/2 Ising-like model and a (logistic) Fermi-Dirac-like function to describe the spread of Covid-19. Our analysis reinforces well-established literature results, namely: {\textbackslash}emph\{i\}) that the epidemic curves can be described by a Gaussian-type function; {\textbackslash}emph\{ii\}) that the temporal evolution of the accumulative number of infections and fatalities follow a logistic function, which has some resemblance with a distorted Fermi-Dirac-like function; {\textbackslash}emph\{iii\}) the key role played by the quarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an {\textbackslash}emph\{interacting\} parameter, which emulates the contact between infected and non-infected people. Furthermore, in the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that: {\textbackslash}emph\{i\}) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of a person being infected with Covid-19; {\textbackslash}emph\{ii\}) the concepts of blocked and non-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person respecting or not the social distancing, impacting thus in the probability of an infected person to infect other people. Increasing the number of infected people leads to an increase in the number of net connections, giving rise thus to a higher probability of new infections (percolation). We demonstrate the importance of social distancing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 in a pedagogical way. Given the impossibility of making a precise forecast of the disease spread, we highlight the importance of taking into account additional factors, such as climate changes and urbanization, in the mathematical description of epidemics. Yet, we make a connection between the standard mathematical models employed in epidemics and well-established concepts in condensed matter Physics, such as the Fermi gas and the Landau Fermi-liquid picture.},

	abstract = {A critical phenomenon is an intrinsic feature of traffic dynamics, during which transition between isolated local flows and global flows occurs. However, very little attention has been given to the question of how the local flows in the roads are organized collectively into a global city flow. Here we characterize this organization process of traffic as “traffic percolation,” where the giant cluster of local flows disintegrates when the second largest cluster reaches its maximum. We find in real-time data of city road traffic that global traffic is dynamically composed of clusters of local flows, which are connected by bottleneck links. This organization evolves during a day with different bottleneck links appearing in different hours, but similar in the same hours in different days. A small improvement of critical bottleneck roads is found to benefit significantly the global traffic, providing a method to improve city traffic with low cost. Our results may provide insights on the relation between traffic dynamics and percolation, which can be useful for efficient transportation, epidemic control, and emergency evacuation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents two new strategies that can be used to greatly improve the speed of connected component labeling algorithms. To assign a label to a new object, most connected component labeling algorithms use a scanning step that examines some of its neighbors. The first strategy exploits the dependencies among them to reduce the number of neighbors examined. When considering 8-connected components in a 2D image, this can reduce the number of neighbors examined from four to one in many cases. The second strategy uses an array to store the equivalence information among the labels. This replaces the pointer based rooted trees used to store the same equivalence information. It reduces the memory required and also produces consecutive final labels. Using an array instead of the pointer based rooted trees speeds up the connected component labeling algorithms by a factor of 5 {\textasciitilde}; 100 in our tests on random binary images.},

	abstract = {Solutions of the linearized Landau-Ginzburg equations on networks of thin wires are studied. We derive linear-difference equations for the value of the order parameter at the junctions of the net with the use of the explicit form of the solutions on the wires. The technique is shown to be applicable to the diffusion equation, to harmonic lattice vibrations, and to the Schrödinger equation and results in equations similar to tight-binding equations. The equations are solved and the upper critical field is determined for some simple finite nets, for the infinite square net, and for the triangular Sierpinski gasket. Dead-end side branches are shown to lead to a mass renormalization. On the square net the equations map on the Azbel-Hofstadter-Aubry model. When the coherence length is small, vortex cores can be accommodated in the holes of the net and there is no upper critical field. The equations on the Sierpinski gasket are solved by an iterative decimation process. The process determines a new length scale proportional to a power of the bare coherence length. The upper critical field is studied for a finite gasket and for a lattice of gaskets. With the use of scaling arguments the results are applied to percolation clusters. Far from the percolation threshold the results are described by a renormalized correlation length of standard form. When this length becomes shorter than the correlation length for the percolation problem the critical field is shown to be constant or decreasing as the threshold is approached. Existing experiments are discussed and the importance of high-field-susceptibility measurements is emphasized.},
